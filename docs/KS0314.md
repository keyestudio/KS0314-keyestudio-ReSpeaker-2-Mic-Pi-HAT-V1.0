# keyestudio ReSpeaker 2-Mic Pi HAT V1.0

![KS0314](./media/KS0314.png)

## Overview

This is keyestudio ReSpeaker 2-Mic Pi HAT V1.0 shield designed for AI and voice applications. It is a low power stereo Codec based on the  WM8960.
  There are two microphones on the shield for sound collection, three  APA102 RGB LEDs, one user button and two connectors for application  extension. The shield comes with a 2.54mm Grove cable  
 In addition, a 3.5mm audio jack or XH2.54-2P speaker output can be used for audio output.
 With this shield, you can build a more powerful and flexible voice  product that integrates Amazon Amazona voice services, Google Assistant, and more.
 Note:After plugging in speaker module, the status of RGB LED is not stable; however,the status is normal when testing RGB.

**Enter the \*unzip seeed-voicecard-6.1.zip\* to unzip the package**

![image-20240430160924358](./media/image-20240430160924358.png)

**Then enter the \*cd seeed-voicecard-6.1\* into the folder**

**Installation finished and reboot.**

![image-20240430162311641](./media/image-20240430162311641.png)unzip "

**unzip "mic_hat-master.zip", and refer to "seeed-voicecard-6.1.zip"**

```bash
arecord -D "plughw:3,0" -f S16_LE -r 16000 -d 5 -t wav test.wav
aplay -D "plughw:3,0" test.wav
```

![image-20240430164403006](./media/image-20240430164403006.png)

**Note:** "plughw:3,0" is the recording(or playback device number) , depending on your system this number may differ (for example on Raspberry Pi 0 it will be 0, since it doesn't have audio jack) We can find it via "arecord -l" and "aplay -l".

**Test the 3 LEDs on the shield.**

All the Python scripts, mentioned in the examples below can be found inside this repository. To install the necessary dependencies, from mic_hat repository folder, run

```bash
sudo apt-get install portaudio19-dev libatlas-base-dev
```

**APA102 LEDs**

Each on-board APA102 LED has an additional driver chip. The driver chip takes care of receiving the desired color via its input lines, and then holding this color until a new command is received.

```bash
python3 interfaces/pixels.py
```

**User Button**

There is an on-board User Button, which is connected to GPIO17. Now we will try to detect it with python and RPi.GPIO.

Execute the following code from mic_hat folder repository, which you cloned at Step 4.

```bash
python3 interfaces/button.py
```

It should display "on" when you press the button:

```bash
python3 button.py
```

Output like
